# PROJECT NAME
Weekend-Jquery-Server-Calculator

## Description
Time to complete project: 25 hours

This project is a calculator app created with focus on connections between the client and server using POST and GET methods.
I spent roughly 4 hours thinking of how I was going to go about this project. In that time I also set up my files and created the "barebones" structure for my index.html. 
The rest of the time was split about half and half on syling and half on the logic.

## Installation

When you have your numbers in the two inputs provided, the equal button will perform a calculation on those numbers based on the operator you selected (" + = * / ").
You will either be given a prompt or simply not be able to see your result if you forget to input numbers. Additionally,
if you change a value within the the input box, you will have to reselect an operator to use. You may click the equal(submit) button right after clicking it if you haven't changed the numbers in the input. You may also select a different operator and then submit a new calculation as long as the numbers haven't changed. 
I added media queries to make the page more responsive. I added fun sounds to add to the theme...you'll have to click around to find them (there are three!). 

## Usage
For making simple calculations between two numbers, including floating point integers. Can use the history log on the side for comparison needs.
